**Dish Details Screen**

  * Should show the details of a Dish in one Screen, or a Modal.

**Shopping Cart Screen**

   * Lists all selected Dishes
   * The user can unselect a Dish, which will remove it from the screen

**Success Screen**

    * Simple success screen to tell the user that everything went fine

**Backend**

  * Backend team and frontend team can sometimes be non synchronous, so to build your part and overcome this non synchronicity:
Just Mock your data.

**Bonus**

   * Persist your data, with Localstorage, Asyncstorageâ€¦whatever. - I just want to be able to leave the app and come back and see that my selection is still there
